of capitalism the term late capitalism began to be used by socialists in continental europe towards the end of the and in the when many economists believed capitalism was doomed at the end of world war ii many economists including joseph schumpeter and paul samuelson believed the end of capitalism could be near in that the economic problems might be insurmountable the term was used in the in germany and austria by western marxists writing in the tradition of the frankfurt school and austromarxism leo michielsen and andre gorz popularized the term neo capitalism in france and belgium with

cultural theorist frederic jameson thought rudolf hilferding term the latest stage of capitalism jüngster kapitalismus perhaps more prudent and less prophetic sounding but jameson often used late capitalism in his writings hegel theme of the end of history was rekindled by kojève in his introduction to the reading of hegel the end of history is discussed by francis fukuyama in the sense that liberal democracy is the ultimate form of society which cannot be surpassed by anything that is superior to it because there does not and cannot exist anything superior in modern usage late capitalism often refers to new mix of high tech advances the concentration of speculative financial capital post fordism and growing gap between rich and poor mandel according to the marxist economist ernest mandel who popularised the term with his phd dissertation late stage capitalism will be dominated by the machinations or perhaps better fluidities of financial capital and also by the increasing commodification and of ever more inclusive sectors of human life mandel believed that far from representing post industrial society late capitalism constitutes generalized universal for the first time in history up to the mid mandel preferred to use the term neo capitalism which was most often used by intellectuals in belgium and france around that time this term drew attention to new of capitalism but at the time ultra leftist marxists objected to it because according to them it might suggest that capitalism was no longer capitalism and it might lead to reformist errors rather than the overthrow of capitalism in his work late capitalism mandel distinguished three periods in the development of the capitalist mode of production freely competitive capitalist production roughly from to through the growth of industrial capital in domestic markets the phase of monopoly capitalism roughly from to and is characterized by the imperialist competition for international markets and the exploitation of colonial territories the epoch of late capitalism emerging out of the second world war which has as its dominant features the multinational corporation globalized markets and labor mass consumption and the space of liquid multinational flows of capital in the tradition of the orthodox marxists mandel tried to characterize the nature of the modern epoch as whole with reference to the main laws of motion of capitalism specified by marx mandel aim was to explain the unexpected revival of capitalism after world war ii contrary to leftist and the long economic boom which showed the fastest economic growth ever seen in human history his work has produced new interest in the theory of long waves in economic development fredric jameson fredric jameson borrowed mandel vision as basis for his widely cited postmodernism or the cultural logic of late capitalism jameson postmodernity involves new mode of cultural production developments in literature film fine art video social theory etc which differs markedly from the preceding era of modernism particularly in its treatment of subject position temporality and narrative in the modernist era the dominant ideology was that society could be re engineered on the basis of scientific and technical knowledge and on the basis of popular consensus about the meaning of progress from the second half of the th century however modernism was gradually eclipsed by postmodernism which is skeptical about social engineering and features lack of consensus about the meaning of progress in the wake of rapid technological and social change all the old certainties have broken down this begins to destabilize every part of life making almost everything malleable changeable transient and impermanent jameson argues that every position on postmodernism today whether apologia or stigmatization is also necessarily an implicitly or explicitly political stance on the nature of multinational capitalism today section of jameson analysis has been reproduced on the marxists internet archive jameson regards the late capitalist stage as new and previously unparalleled development with global reach whether defined as multinational or informational capitalism at the same time late capitalism diverges from marx prognosis for the final stage of capitalism in popular culture character in thomas pynchon novel bleeding edge states late
